            <h1>About Me</h1>

            <p>
                Ever since I first got into coding, it’s been more than just a hobby — it’s what inspired me to pursue a degree in Computer Engineering. 
                I’m currently a student with a growing background in software development and a strong interest in both programming and hardware.
                <br>
                I’ve worked with a variety of programming languages like Python, Go, Java, and C#, and 
                I’ve been exploring the world of web development through HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
                My interest in hands-on tech also led me to robotics — I was the programming lead on my FIRST Robotics team, where I collaborated closely 
                with others on both the design and mechanical sides of the project.
                <br>
                In high school, I took AP computer science classes and picked up Microsoft Office certifications for Word and Excel. 
                Later on, I earned a computer networking certification in college to broaden my understanding of how systems connect and communicate.
                <br>
                I enjoy helping others when I can, whether it’s through answering questions or sharing resources I’ve found helpful. 
                If you ever want to reach out, feel free to email me. If you'd like to chat by phone, just include your number and a quick intro in your message — 
                that way I can get back to you when the timing’s right. Looking forward to connecting!
            </p>

                        for some of my programs. My purpose for trying so many languages is to allow me to find the languages
                        I am most productive in and also to use the most effective tool for the project I wish to develop.
